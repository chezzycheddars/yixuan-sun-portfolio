# My Portfolio

Hi! My name is Yixuan Sun. I am a STEM enthusiast with strong interests in computer science, mathematics, swimming, and narrative writing. 
This repository serves as a portfolio of my projects and experiences as I transition into more advanced, college-level coding.

## Skills
- Programming: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Lua, Luau
- Problem-solving and logical thinking
- Mathematics
- Narrative writing
- Competitive swimming (discipline, goal-setting, perseverance)

## Significant Experiences

### Building a Minecraft-Inspired Game
Scratch was what first sparked my interest in coding. Later, while taking coding courses through CodeWizardsHQ, I worked on a Minecraft-inspired game as one of my first major projects.
This experience was meaningful because it was the first time I realized that code is a creative tool. I learned that programming isn’t just about syntax—it’s about turning ideas into something real. That realization motivated me to continue learning and experimenting with code.

### Watching the Olympic Swimming Trials
Watching the Olympic swimming trials was what inspired me to start swimming competitively. 
I previously played soccer, but over time, I realized it wasn’t the right fit for me. With encouragement from my mom, I tried swimming and eventually came to love it.
This experience taught me the importance of exploring new interests and committing fully to something meaningful. 
The discipline and persistence I’ve developed through swimming have a strong influence on how I approach learning computer science.

## Goals
- Build meaningful software that can be useful in everyday life
- Continue developing my computer science skills through challenging projects
- Learn additional programming languages to expand my creative and technical abilities
- Compete at the highest level in swimming while maintaining academic growth

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.
