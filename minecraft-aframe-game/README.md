# Minecraft A-Frame Game

- Clicking the Red Block switches your mode to place blocks
- Clicking the Spinning Blue Block switches your mode to spin blocks. Whenever you click on a block with this mode on, it makes the block spin.
- Clicking the Shovel switches your mode to delete, letting you delete already placed blocks and send them back into your inventory.
- Click on the Pole to change the color of your next placed blocks.
- Sometimes a Hamburger randomly spawns; touch it to heal.
- Steve will sometimes spawn, and he will play music when he is present. 
- You lose health as time passes.
- WASD keys to move.
- The circle in the middle of your screen is used to click, not your actual mouse cursor.

Thank you for checking this out and playing! This project is by far my favorite and is the first project I created that has gotten me completely hooked into coding.
